"""
Neural network module for Stochastic MuZero reinforcement learning.

This module provides:
- Model builders for all Stochastic MuZero networks
- Network class (original 3-model wrapper) for backward compatibility
- StochasticNetwork class (full 5-model wrapper) for Stochastic MuZero
- Utility functions for tensor conversion
